<h2>About Us</h2>
<br>
<h3>Over 10 Years Experience</h3>
<p>Elite Cricket Performance Academy aims to bring coaching from a professional and international level back down to grassroots levels so that players have access to elite information at an earlier stage.

    We aim to create a positive challenging environment that helps players begin to think for themselves and understand their own game better. With a blend of teaching styles we can give technical/tactical information but also setup drills where the players can explore solutions themselves and feedback to us what they have discovered.
    
    Players have more than a single option so we can find solutions that should work for every player as they are all different in how they move and think.
    
    We have had 10 players in 2022 trial for England in the Bunbury Festival, we have about 83 County Players at the academy with players on County Emerging Player Programmes and County Academies, some are playing in the Mens and Womens 2nd and 1st Xiâ€™s.
    
    We have developed programmes to bring world class basics in Fielding, Batting, Spin Bowling, Pace Bowling and Wicket Keeping to our players.
    
    We have various specialists who help form the curriculum from Sprint coaches, Baseball Coaches for Throwing and Power Hitting, Strength and Conditioning to leaders in their fields of Expertise for each of the technical skills within cricket.
    
    We have guest Masterclasses open to the academy members where international level coaches deliver workshops on themes that help build upon what we teach and believe in at the Academy.
    
    The Academy is open for all players or any gender aged 5-18 and professionals/internationals beyond that.
    
    We run school programmes for State Schools including developing leadership skills through cricket.</p><br>
